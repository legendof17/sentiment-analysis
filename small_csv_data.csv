0,Blue Jean Teddy Mobile My sons love this! It was one of the first toys they smiled at! Especially the panda which they follow around and smile when it comes back to them. The music plays for quite a while too. I also like the button on top that allows you to stop the music if you want.
1,FuzziBunz Fleece Portable Changing Pad (Watermelon) I ordered this product strictly because it claimed to be waterproof and it was red. There aren\'t a lot of red items for babies and I hate that most of them items for baby boys are ugly blue and brown and disgusting looking patterns. This changing pad it very soft on both sides and the red side is actually waterproof. I love this using this when I go out because I do not like dirty public restrooms. I don\'t want to touch anything in them but sadly now that I have another baby I have to use public restrooms when we\'re out. These are the perfect size to keep my son free from germs. The only problem is that when he\'s moving around because he\'s mad or playing when I change him the cloth moves also. If I could make one suggestion to the creator of this product it would be to make it a little wider and longer so when babies move it still completely covers those nasty changing tables. I also use this product at home when I\'m changing my son on the couch or ottoman just incase he decides to surprise my furniture with a little squirt.
2,"Infantino Squeeze and Stack Block Set These are brightly colored, somewhat squishy, they squeak, are easy to grab blocks and good for a teething baby blocks. My 5 month old loves them. Would stongly recommend as 1st blocks."
3,"Munchkin Click Lock Straw Cup - 9 oz - 2 pk - Colors May Vary I\'ve been trying to transition my 11 month old twins to sippy cups and have literally tried 10 different types. This is the only one they can easily drink out of. Regular sippy cups were too fast or slow flowing, plus they didn\'t understand the concept of tilting the cup. Straw cups were too difficult. The mouthpiece on this cup is almost nipple-like, and incredibly intuitive. The straw makes it easy to drink from. Plus it\'s spill-proof. It\'s amazing to finally see my twins self-feed!!"
4,"Graco SnugRide Classic Connect 30/35 Infant Car Seat Base, Silver Perfect match and fit. I love the Graco Classice Connect, its so quick and convenient. Also love that I was able to find this extra base online."
5,"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover \'N Grow This gym has great colors and the toys interested a 2 1/2 month old. I felt the construction was inferior and he did get his hand caught in the hanging ring which is of concern. He did not use his feet to play music. Maybe he will do that when he is older."
6,Fisher-Price Giggle Gang Plush Toy - Orange I like this toy. It is cute and the giggles it make are very cute. My 8-month girls like it a lot.
7,"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch Orig. review:Sound and video broke after a few months. It worked at first but now always displays out of range and hard to use. The control functions on the remote control do not function any more either. Do not buy this monitorUpdate:Samsung USA was able to replace the defective product. We have had the replacement monitor now for about a month and a half and have been very happy so far.  Video and audio is sharp and product has been reliable thus far.  In the interim period between monitors, tried two other companies\' products and was not happy with screen size or features.  Overall. Samsung has the best package in terms of all around well-rounded product."
8,"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish I really do like the product, however it did mildew (the tag says it won\'t). I am having to throw it out after having it for 2 months.  It just keeps getting mildew spots no matter what I do!"
9,"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane I needed a new car seat because my beautiful baby was starting to weigh out of her current car seat. My son has one similar and figured might as well stay with the same brand.  They are easy to use and work great.  No issues or concerns so far."
10,"UPPAbaby Stroller Parent Organizer, Black Extremely useful. Love it. Don\'t get the cup holder it does not attach well. Use this instead. Highly recommended. User friendly."
11,"Blue LED Night Light Auto On/Off I expected a little more of a ""night light"" from this. It barely gives off a glow. And it is on, even when the room is mostly lit up. Almost never turns off."
12,"Graco Cozy Dinette Highchair, Mickey I bought this highchair for my 8 month old daughter.  Overall it has been a great purchase for a great price.  She loves sitting in it not only to eat but also to hang out while I cook.  She fits in it great and it is very easy to clean.  There are a few things I don\'t like about the highchair.  First, the wheels aren\'t great making it difficult to maneuver when she is in it.  The other thing is the snap tray is very difficult to use.  We accommodate this by always sliding our daughter in from the top.  Overall we are very happy with the highchair and glad we made the purchase."
13,"Munchkin Dora the Explorer Sports Bottle, Colors May Vary This has become my daughters newest favorite cup. She loves it and wants to take it everywhere. Its a good cup but it did leak some, so no throwing in my bag, but perfect otherwise."
14,"Munchkin Quick Install 26&quot; Gate, Black It is a very easy product to use and much easier than any other product like this. However it does not open as wide as it advertises. I would recommend this product as long as you are not trying to use it at its max."
15,"Cosco Scenera Convertible Car Seat Black it is safe, simple, comfortable and cheap.has two settings -- for awake sitting and sleeping (recline)one downside, which is in almost all other toddler car seats is that there is no hood to put down when the baby wants to sleep/ reduce the light on her face (like there is in a stroller)"
16,Dr. Brown\'s 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 2 Standard Nipple Love these bottles. Not the easiest to wash but my baby seems to enjoy them. The nipple is the perfect shape.
17,"babyletto Hudson 3 in 1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Espresso/White Love my new babyletto crib. Quality and Price is right. Perfect for a modern nursery style for a boy or girl."
18,"Kiddopotamus Cradler Adjustable Head Support for Newborns to Toddlers, Ivory Teddy Bears I just use these to support my toddlers head if she falls asleep in the car seat.  I kind of just slip them in on either side of head and they usually stay there on own.  I must admit that I don\'t have them on all the time because it seems that they would make her hot.  Anyway, they are cute and light weight and soft and do keep her head from flopping over to one side, although it still can flop forward."
19,"Stokke Tripp Trapp Highchair, Red We have had this chair since my son was 8 months old, and he is now almost 4.  We love it.  Unlike with other high chairs, he is right there with the family at mealtimes and not set back from the table because a tray is in the way.I disagree with an earlier review that this chair can tip.  Just look at the picture and you will see that it is nearly impossible.  My son tries it all the time and has never once succeeded in lifting it more than an inch or two off the floor.  The chair is solid, a bit heavy, and built to last."
20,"Evenflo Chase LX Harnessed Booster Car Seat, Reese It is a good car seat. You can tell not the best quality but still good for short rides. We also have a Diono Radian and you can tell the difference in the finition. I can\'t tell if a more expensive one is safer or not... I just find it sad that Diono is so expensive. So for this price, this car seat is a deal."
21,"Dr. Brown\'s Standard Dishwashing Basket, Polypropylene This makes washing the Dr. Brown\'s bottles sooo much easier!! Easy and very convenient. I love this product! I only wish it had a designated area for the travel rings.  Overall, this is wonderful!"
22,"Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy i have a phil&ted\'s explorer and, other than theirs (which i refused to spend $30 on), no cupholders worked.  they either kept slipping or couldn\'t make it over the rather thick handles/frame.  this thing is great--you can make it as loose or tight as you want and it\'s surprisingly stable.  plus, in addition to space for two beverages, there\'s room to stick the random baby/toddler items that endlessly drop from the stroller (i.e. hats, socks, toys).  so wish i had found this a year ago when we got the stroller.  GREAT PRICE!"
23,"Lansinoh mOmma Straw Cup with Dual Handles, Orange I was very excited to receive this cup, but it\'s just ok. I really like the small amount of water that is allowed out of the straw at a time. My 6 month old has no problem sucking the water through the straw, and since not much is allowed to pass at once, this prevents him from drinking the entire cup in 2 minutes (a good thing!)However, the weighted straw does NOT follow the liquid, it doesn\'t move at all. I\'ve tried changing its position and everything, it does not move. Therefore when my baby tilts the cup in any way at all, he cannot get any water.Cup is round and tends to roll, but I have not had any issues with leaks."
24,"Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump I bought this pump around 4 months ago, as I returned to work.  It has its strengths: it is quiet, easily portable, and easy to use.  However, mothers should think hard about their plans before deciding to purchase a personal-use pump rather than rent a hospital-grade model.  After 5 months, the motor on my pump has deteriorated a lot, and more importantly, I have had a serious drop in my milk supply.  Even in the beginning, I rarely got more than 4 oz in a session, and now, I can spend 30 minutes or more just getting 2-3 oz.  I have had to start supplementing my baby with formula even when I am home all day because of decreasing supply.When I spoke with my doctor, she told me this was fairly common, and that many women have to switch pumps to a hospital-grade pump after 6-9 months (3-6 months after returning to work).  The Medela advanced is very good for a personal use pump, but I am out several hundred dollars for 4 months of breastpump use, when I could have rented a hospital-grade machine for that period for substantially less.Basically, be aware of what you are buying, and be aware that factors outside of your control may influence this.  Keep product lifespan in mind when choosing to buy rather than rent."
25,"Graco SnugRide 35/32 Infant Car Seat Base, Silver My husband and I take turns picking up the baby, so it is nice to have a base in both cars. We have a snugride 35- Graco"
26,"Dreamer Design Ditto Jogger Lite - Red/Gray The stroller glides so well it seems to encourage you to move faster. The canopies have multiple positions to block out setting or rising suns. The storage below doesn\'t accommodate any large bags, though, there is plenty of room for loose items. The twins love the open ride. Not a stroller for feeding them if you need a tray."
27,"Evenflo Triumph65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Mosaic It is a nice reasonably priced carseat. My little one is very comfortable in and thanks to the weight limits, it should last us a long time."
28,"Kair Air Cushioned Bath Visor, Blue My son hates and I mean hates getting his hair washed. This started when he was 2 years old. He use to love it. We\'ve tried dumping water over his head to get it over with, have him sit on my lap and I lean his head in the bathtub and wash his hair while he looks up, and all sorts of tricks. He cries and cries. We thought it may have been the shampoo and switched countless times. Well, I finally went on a blog and got some advise about a shower visor so I bought this one based on its reviews. We first allowed my son to play with the visor and then put him in a bath tub while he was in a good mood and not so tired. We played with bubbles then I used a wet wash cloth to get his hair wet enough to shampoo. Then we tried to get this on his head and he screamed like a banshee. I had to have my husband hold his arms while I quickly put this on his head and dump water to rinse. It was quick and effective. The trick is to get him to actually wear this visor without screaming. So the product itself is effective."
29,"Pack N Play Fitted Sheet - 2 Pack - White &amp; Blue These are very reasonably priced considering there are two in a pack.  They are soft and fit securely around the mattress, though are a bit big for my Graco pack n play.  And just for the record, the package I received had 2 BLUE sheets, no white."
30,"Munchkin 60 pieces Foam Bath Learning Toy Pack, Boys My son enjoys these foam pieces. It\'s great that they stick on the walls and we create words etc.Fun bath time toy!"
31,Sassy Baby\'s Mam 9 oz. Boy 3 pack Bottle These bottles are BPA free and fit the Avent bottle nipples so we were able to move our girls over with out causing any problems.  The lids fit on wierdly though so you need to make sure you have them on the correct grooves or your baby will be covered in milk!
32,"Nuby 3 Stage Wide Neck Feeding Bottle, 10 Ounce We used these bottles in the transition away from baby bottles. Our daughter took to it right away and we thought we had finally found a winner. But after repeated use and washing each of the nipples leak, the vent hole also leaks. We have to change soggy shirts a few times when we used these. Still looking for the best sippy cup for our picky daughter!"
33,Bamboobies Super-Soft Washable Nursing Pads - All Pale Pink These breast pads a soft and work well.  Anyone with a baby does LOTS of laundry so throwing these into a load is easy.  It makes much more sense to purchase these to use for the duration rather than purchasing disposable ones each month.  They\'re much cuter too!
34,"Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors Connects umbrella strollers easily, and the two strollers combine are easy to maneuver, however CANNOT FIT THROUGH DOORWAYS. Don\'t recommend this product, unless you are willing to disconnect strollers every time you go through a standard door."
35,"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Sleeping Bag, Oh Boy, Small I love that this is lightweight and airy - other sleepsacks are too thick and not feasible in the summertime."
36,"Graco Quattro Tour Deluxe Stroller, Zurich Great stroller. It does everything I need it to do with ease. Great turning radius and handles the walks pretty well. Though, this is not an off road stroller. Stick to walkways. Gravel or dirt is a pain to navigate through. Also, very heavy but worth it for the quality. Easy folding. Great rubber wheels!"
37,"Mickey Mouse,Cars,Toy Story Bath Sets (Cars) The towel is nice and of great quality; I just would have preferred a regular wash cloth instead of a wash mitt."
38,"Leachco Easy Teether XL Side Crib Rail Cover, 2 Pack, Ivory Like another reviewer said, this isn\'t the most stylish crib accessory.  But if your goal is to protect the crib rails from baby bites, it does the trick!  I have these side rail covers and also the front rail cover (why don\'t they sell them together in a package?).  My son is a teething monster, but the crib rails still look brand new.  These are easy to install, and easy to remove and (machine) wash out the baby slobber.  I spent $500 on the convertible crib, and I actually want it to last through the toddler bed & full-size stages.Well worth the $$!"
39,"North States Supergate Stairway Gate I bought this Supergate Stairway Gate to protect my son. I found out it damaged when it\'s shipped  to my house, I checked it, and decided to return it back. I bought other gate, this time it made by iron. The new gate is heavy but it works good. You should buy North States Supergate Stairway Gate if your stair width is not wide too much."
40,"WubbaNub Monkey &quot;It\'s a Boy&quot; Pacifier This item was lost n the mail, vendor worked with us to make very fair deal.I would definitely recommend doing business with them."
41,"Icy Diamond Tote - Small Insulated Bag for insulin, snacks, teethers (Blue) Perfect for five day hikes.  I can take my medicine with me  without a worry."
42,"Baby Tracker &reg; - Daily Childcare Schedule Recordkeeper (1 Year Binder - Refillable) The product title says ""Daily Childcare schedule"", and I think that is exactly what it is intended for. I have 10-month-old twins, and have used this product since they were 3 months old and began attending a family daycare. Since it\'s not a commercial daycare and they are the only children in the home, our childcare provider didn\'t use any standard sort of daily updates sent home with parents. I had created my own logs that I printed out, but it just became too much work, and I could never format it the way i wanted.I was SO happy to find this product. It includes all of the daily information I wanted (sleep times, feedings, changings, play times, and any other comments) all on one page. Since I have twins, we just record the information for one on the front and the other on the back. I also really appreciate the extras that are included besides the daily tracking pages, especially the list of foods and notes on each. This was extremely helpful when our babies began eating solid foods.If you are considering purchasing this just for yourself, I would probably recommend an iPhone app like BabyConnect or BabyTracker, but if you have a nanny or other childcare provider for your babies and are looking for a place to keep track of their days and other important information like food introduction, medicine, etc., this could be really useful to you."
43,"Rich Frog Peggy Pig Rubber Toy my son (almost 10 months) loves this pig and has since he was about four months old.  we love everything about it.  the ears, nose, and feet are all great to chew on, plus it makes him smile because it\'s so cute.  we got it as a gift and the reason i looked it up on amazon today is because we lost it on a trip and need to get another one because he loves it so much.  i was surprised to see the other bad review so i wanted to add my two cents.  maybe that buyer got a bad one, but we think it\'s great."
44,"Vulli So\'Pure Teether Duet, Sophie the Giraffe I feel fortunate that I had already purchased another Sophie set from the manufacturer store. When this item arrived it was apparent to a naked eye that the toys were fake. They are a little bit bigger than the authentic one, they are much sloppier made, and the logo is a little bigger and again, just sloppier. Again, if you put authentic and fake toy side by side, it is very apparent which one is genuine.  It is a shame that Amazon allows this item to be sold on their website, but I raised an issue with them. Again, Sophie the giraffe is a great teether. My daughter loves it. But the best thing about it, that it is made of natural rubber and safe for little ones. Well, that would be the case ONLY if the item is authentic. This particular seller provides a fake version of a well known teether toy and they should be banned from Amazon. Please do not purchase this item if you care about the quality of your baby toys."
45,"Boon Scrubble Interchangeable Bath Toy Squirt Set,Orange I bought these for my 3 month old to grow into, but my 3 year old ended up enjoying them too. The plastic is pliable and durable. I like that they will be easy to clean. I would definitely buy these again!"
46,"Disney Princess - Inflatable Safety Bathtub for Baby She is always attracted to princess stuff.  She didn\'t really seem to notice the style of this.  But she laughed when we put her in it.  Even though it was close to bedtime, she played in it for 20 min.  In her whale tub we got her for her infancy she was really limited in movement.  Since she\'s a good sitter we needed something else.  We only fill it about an inch with water (it gathers around her weight when she sits).  It really cuts down on water compared to a full tub.  It stays warmer than a full tub.  It travels easily and inflates fast (even just blowing into it).  We have to keep our hands on her at all times as she can faceplant or scoot down if not watching.  She\'ll have this tub for a good while until she\'s ready for the full experience."
47,The Shrunks Indoor Toddler Inflatable Travel Bed I bought this for my 2 year old to be used while vacationing. It is easy to set up and crib sheets fit the mattress perfectly.  My toddler loved having his own little bed while away from home. I would recommend it to any parent who wants a safe and comfortable place for their toddler to sleep.
48,"Peg-Perego 2011 Primo Viaggio Infant Car Seat, Pois Black I bought this for my new born grandson. It looks like it it very safe and sturdy. Everything is easily adjustable unlike other brands I have tried. There is nothing negative about this carrier. It\'s light weight, and easy to carry at your side. The baby fits in it perfectly, nice and snug. The base is easy to mount in the cars and SUVs I have tried it in. When taking a taxi we just use the carrier itself. I was definitely the hero at the baby shower with everyone admiring the carrier."
49,"Circo&Acirc;&reg; Comforter - Transportation I bought this comforter, along with the coordinating bumper pad, for my grandson\'s crib at my house. I was surprised with the quality of this comforter, it\'s edged in a very soft fine wale corduroy, and the designs are nicely outlined with stitching, giving them a puffy look, the designs also have nice embroidered detail. All in all, a well made adorable little comforter for a baby boy!"
50,"Cotton Tale Designs Lemon Drop Fitted Sheet This is a nice crib sheet, at a decent price.  Nice pale color, kind of greenish-blue dots.I wish I had bought two."
51,"Samsung Smart View Baby Monitor Going to keep this short and sweet since everyone else\'s reviews hit it on the nose. The parent unit literally NEVER stops vibrating and I\'ll one up everyone else\'s horror story by telling you that I have to turn the audio all the way down on my unit because if I try to listen in on what my baby is doing it emitts a horrific screeching sound. Did I mention this is my second unit?? Had to return the first one because the night vision did not work. Now this. EXTREMELY disappointed and returning the unit today and shopping for another brand completely. For 200 dollars, I expected much, much more."
52,"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black Grandma was not ready to give up leather seating in her car and wanted something to protect the leather from damage when a booster seat was installed.  The Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver seemed to be what I was looking for.  Not only was it somewhat more rigid than other seat protectors, but it came in tan so that it matched my car\'s interior.  Additionally, since I live in south Texas, the lighter color is more desirable for purposes of keeping the vehicle\'s interior from getting so hot.  There should be no issue with the seat saver staining the lighter leather black as, based on reviewers\' comments, some other brands do.The Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver was easy to install.  The base filled one of the back ""bucket"" seats; the seat saver\'s back needed to have been about 4"" longer to completely protect the booster seat back from coming in contact with the vehicle\'s seat.  Further, it would have been helpful if each side of the Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver had tabs that extended over the seat back.  That would have prevented the booster seat straps from digging into the vehicle\'s seat when the booster seat was correctly installed.  Because of the vehicle\'s seat depth, the Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver\'s front flap does not ""bend"" at the marked area, but still provides a bit of protection to the seat edge.  Having a little one who likes to ""drum"" his feet makes me appreciate this feature; I do wish the flap had been a bit longer and had multiple grooves for bending.There was no sliding of the Britax Frontier 85 SICT Booster Seat which was installed on this seat saver; the booster seat held firmly in place.  The backing on the Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver is a rubber-like mesh, similar to the material used to keep floor rugs from sliding.  Since I have not yet had the seat in place during one of our very hot Texas summers, I do not know whether there will be a sticking problem.  I will probably remove the booster seat during the summer unless our little one is visiting so that I can avoid this potential problem.I would have rated the Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver a 4.5, if that rating had been available.  With the exception of the suggested changes, I am very pleased with this product."
53,"Safety 1st Prograde No Drill Top Of Door Lock I agree with the other positive reviews: including, installs and removes in seconds. For a trip to ""Grandma\'s house"", I took them off our doors and then popped them on the doors at my mom\'s place. Quickly childproofing the rooms our toddler shouldn\'t enter.The only con is the relatively high price compared to other childproofing methods. But it\'s so sturdy it looks like I can resell it when we\'re done."
54,"OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack (White) I bought two packs of these for cloth diapering and they\'re great!  Material is soft, but sturdy and will hold up to lots of washing.  Excellent wipes by an excellent company!"
55,"San-X Tarepanda Figure Plush Doll Stuffed Toy Sz L So to begin I absolutely adore Tare. He\'s so squishy, cute, and looks really well made. I can\'t get enough of him!However, I paid for a large with 15.7&#34; x 11&#34; x 6.3&#34; (40 x 28 x 16 cm) dimensions. Yet, my panda is half that size. Meaning I\'ve paid more than necessary for what I was looking for. I\'m tempted to return so I can get a bigger size but I don\'t know how to do that honestly and don\'t want to wait for it to come again. Plus, I\'m happy enough with Tare to just let sleeping dogs lie and rate this a 3."
56,"Ostart 8 White Baby Furniture Corner Safety Bumper Security Table Desk Corner Edge Protector Guard Cushion Softener it is alot bigger than what u see in the picture! the sticker dont really work and it keep dropping when somebody pass by and we have to use a staple gun to fix it. Oh by the way, take forever to get here.."
57,"Graco Blossom 4-In-1 Seating System, Sapphire We almost didn\'t buy a regular high chair as we have a Phil & Teds clip on chair as well as a Stokke Trip Trap + infant seat.  However our baby wasn\'t the best sitter when we started solid foods and we wanted something they would feel secure in.  We have had it now for four months and IT IS AMAZING!  The versatility it has is a lifesaver - it can be a highchair at many different heights, there are three tray options, it can be a chair w/o a base so the baby can sit by you on the floor (secured in while you shower? maybe I did that?).  It can be pulled up to our counter or lowered to pull up to the table.  It is a purchase I almost didn\'t make, was hesitant to make and now the one I am most grateful for.  The extra dollars are worth the extra function as you will use this item every single day.  (One note, we got a cuter/more neutral than what is pictured so it looks great in photos, shop around for the best one for you.)"
58,"Lambs &amp; Ivy Musical Mobile, Butterscotch I got this one for my shower. It wasn\'t the one I had picked out, but it was cute and it had a monkey on it, which was my theme. But... as I found out.. kids like color... This has none... Kids get bored easy.. this plays the same song.. over and over and over..I used it twice.. bought a used one.. and my son giggles, kicks and tries to grab the new one..This one was not worth the money. Bypass. Get something else."
59,"BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red This is so much nicer to clean than the fancy potties with all the cracks.  It\'s a little smaller though.  A good size for under 3 maybe, but not so good for over 3."
60,"Disney Friendship Pooh Lamp Base And Shade Got it as present for GF for her birthday since she needed a lamp for her apartment. Opened the box to find that honey bee to switch the lamp on is BEHIND POOH&#34;S HEADDDDD. AHHHHH. While that was a tragic sight, the lamp works fine and is pretty. I\'d buy another for a present sometimes."
61,NUK 3 Count Orthodontic Bottles Large Dots Design (Boys) not good!
62,"Bright Starts Grab and Spin Rattle Love this rattle. Our daughter loves it so much I ordered this as a back up. She is able to hang on to it, spin it, and use it as a teether."
63,"Mam Nipples Slow Flow, 0+ months, 2 pack THESE NIPPLES ARE A GREAT PRODUCT I LOVE USING THEM MY SON SEEMS TO FAVOR THESEOVER ANYOTHER KIND OF NIPPLE PRODUCTS HIGHLY RECOMENDED IN ALL THE MAM NIPPLE SIZES !"
64,BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector Love this car seat cover. I only wish it were a little bigger to cover more of the seat (of course I understand why that might annoy other people). I like that this cover comes apart and is easy to use with the LATCH system. Hopefully it will keep my seats from the destruction of two little ones.
65,"Baby Doll Bedding Primma Donna Moses Basket, Pink not happy with this item. recieved with items missing and it was replaced and items still missing. this basket was so narrow i doubt a baby more than 6 weeks could stay in it. bought another italian made basket and it was just beautiful. customer service from amazon was great."
66,"Kissa\'s Wool Lover Diaper Cover, Natural, Small This is my first wool cover and I love it.  We use it overnight and the baby is always dry in the morning."
67,"Combi Twin Sport 2 Side by Side Double Stroller in Ember/Wasabi This stroller is like no other in terms of ease of use.  It unfolds with one hand, unlike some more expensive competitor\'s strollers that you must unfold with use of both hands and one foot and even then, very difficult to open.I sling it over my shoulder, so light.Love the storage, it\'s all I need. Pushes well, handles well. Certainly not an all terrain stroller but for short walks and store/mall trips, you can\'t beat it."
68,"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary) Watch out!  The lip right beneath the nipple, on the bottle has groves which are practically impossible to get 100% clean.  We didn\'t realize until very close inspection that mold was growing in ALL of them."
69,"Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red We live an active life style and are either traveling on weekends, or are away from home with our two year old twins doing activities. As they have both been potty trained, I felt that it was important to ensure that they have access to a potty at all times while we are outside the home. After visiting numerous public rest rooms, and repeatedly hearing my twin say `mommy clean it\' each time we entered a public restroom, I decided to search for a portable potty.  When it arrived, it was significantly smaller than I expected, and I appreciated that it came with a storage bag - which I have used for both the potty and the seat inserts.This potty was first used on a 3.5 hour trip to another state and we were all so thankful that it was in the car. Like others, I didn\'t get out it worked initially (since I didn\'t read the instructions), and held it upright while my child when to the bathroom. Later I discovered that you need to push in the legs to ensure that the potty is sturdy and can support a child. Once I figured that out I\'d highly recommend that the potty be placed on a flat surface. We used it in the car, while at an exit gas station (to ensure the safety of our children.) I have both a girl and boy, so I was a little worried about how the seat would work since we are used to either using a toilet seat insert or baby Bjorn potty which has a lot of protection for little boys urinating. It doesn\'t cover quite as well as the baby Bjorn or potty with a raised front, but you can always provide guidance to your child.The inserts work really well, and are simple to fit onto the legs of the potty. They do touch the floor surface in between the potty, which works well as you can ensure that a significant amount of matter can be safely collected by the potty. I didn\'t realize until its first use that the inserts actually work similar to a diaper, and soak up a portion of potty contents. This allowed for me to remove the bag easily and store it in the car until we could find a garbage can.Quite honestly, it\'s been great. It\'s convenient and has been a life saver when you are far away from a rest room and your toddler needs to go immediately. I would say however, that it is important to train your child to hold in for a while, so we use the potty only when we know that it\'s urgent or it\'ll take too long to get to the bathroom.Regarding the size of the potty. My children are smaller than average. However, I do think it is small. For example, my kids may ask to be helped on it, or have a slight drop to it meaning that it\'s not like a regular potty when they can just lean back and sit down; it\'s slightly lower than that comfortable level.  It would be great if the legs extended just a couple more inches.  However this hasn\'t proved to be an issue and I know they prefer this option over public restrooms, as do I. We plan to use this in the back of our car at the state fair. The one thing I would advise is to have a towel or something to cover your kids in the case that you do need to use it outside or in the back of your car. We use it in the back seat floor area of our SUV as we have enough room and can ensure privacy.Like I mentioned earlier, this product is great and I would recommend it to anyone with kids who are being potty trained, or for kids who need to access a potty while traveling."
70,"Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer Bags, 6 Pack, White I had to come back to work when my baby was less than 3 m.o. and chose to continue breastfeeding (via pumping). My work involves travel, sometimes for days, and these packs proved wonderful when there was no other option to sterilize bottles and tubes. all one needs is a microwave and a sink!"
71,Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes A copy of so many other things out there. Only one place to grab hold of and I would not buy again.
72,"Guava Kids Unisex Baby Guava Mitts - Bubbles/Lime - Small/Medium We purchased Guavamitts to thwart our older infant\'s thumb sucking during the night.  He was not quite old enough to locate a pacifier on his own and we didn\'t want the thumb sucking to become a habit.  The typical newborns mittens were not big enough and he could easily yank those off.  I was elated to find these mittens in larger sizes with an adjustable velcro band.  They are easy to get on.  There is plenty of room in the mitten for little fingers to wiggle.  The adjustable velcro allows them to be tightened to stay on for an entire nap or overnight sleeping session.  Although the instructions say to hand wash them, I have only washed them in our front end loader washer/dryer.  I have not noticed any shrinkage whatsoever and the mittens are holding up just fine.  I highly recommend this product if you are looking for something a bit more secure than the average newborn elasticized mittens."
73,"Dream On Me Jayden 4 in 1 Convertible Portable Crib with Changer, Cherry I should have educated myself a little more and purchased a full size crib instead of this odd size. The common bedding for crib will not fit well. This is made in China and seems cheap. I only imagine if this makes it till a three year is using it (it converts to a regular bed) It will be well used and abused."
74,"Safety 1st OnSide Air Protect Convertible Car Seat, Adeline Black I am very happy with this carseat. It is a good quality car seat.Pros:Light weight- I have to take my daughter to the babysitter and leave her car seat. It is lightweight and easy to move.It fits well in small cars- my husband has a ford fiesta and this seat fits easily and he does not have to move his seat far forwardThere is good amount of padding in the head areaThe price is great- if you are looking for a good looking, comfortable, lower price car seat then this is a great choiceCons:It does not recline like some of the other convertible car seats when rear facing.The latch system is not very easy if you are taking it in and out of a car a lot, it has the hook latch not the easy press one like my infant seat had. I use the seatbelt option, that is easier for us.Overall I would recommend this carseat to a friend."
75,"Peg-Perego 2010 Primo Viaggio Infant Car Seat, Red Step We used this until my daughter outgrew it. We LOVE the fact that it\'s compatible with our stroller (the Skate system) and just snaps right into it without having to adjust or anything. Definitely buy it was a set with the Skate system if you are going to purchase a deluxe stroller."
76,"Baby Trend Diaper Champ Diaper Champ or Diaper Genie? That was my dilemma when registering for gifts before my son was born. Lucky for me, I had my Mom with me. She runs a daycare and said Diaper Champ is the best by far and that\'s what I went with. The fact that you can use regular trash bags instead of special cartridges was very appealing to me. Now my son is 6 months old and I must say this thing is GREAT! The only time I catch any smell at all is when I change trash bags. I use those Glad trash bags that are scented to prevent odors and that makes a difference, too. it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it. The only thing you need to watch is the opening latch is a bit tricky (I broke a nail the first time I used it, but then I got the hang of it). I am glad for this, though, because if it\'s not easy for me to open, it won\'t be for my son, either."
77,"Edushape Giant Blocks 16 Pcs Our son is entering that stage were knocking down and building up blocks is a ton of fun.  THese blocks are HUGE and yet soft and light and perfewct for him to crash into, roll around with and generally have a good time.  Highly recommended!"
78,"Infantino Jumbo Shape Sorter We received the Infantino Jumbo toy as a gift for our one-year-old.  It\'s a cute design, but its cheap construction shows in the hard plastic body and the fact that the parts don\'t move very smoothly-- the rotating body especially has a tendency to get stuck.  A minor peeve is that I wish they had used something other than a hexagon for one of the shapes.  It\'s just an awkward word for a baby or toddler to try to learn; something like a heart would be much easier.Circo makes a very similar elephant toy though I can\'t tell who knocked off who since both brands are generic."
79,"NUK Reusable Nursing Pads, 6 Pack Do you like soaking wet bras? Do you enjoy looking like you\'ve just come from a wet t-shirt contest all the time? If so, these pads are fantastic! If not, then you should just go ahead and buy the disposable Lansinoh pads. I thought that I was doing enough laundry every day to keep up with reusable pads- but I was wrong. These were awful. I recommend that you not waste your money or time and pass on these."
80,"The First Years Ignite Stroller Although this stroller is heavier than the umbrella strolller I bought this to replace, I am very satisfied with the easy maneuverability, the height of the handles, and the storage space (though it\'s not much storage space, I had no space on my umbrella stroller, so any amount is an improvement!)  So far I have used this for a walk in the park and for a shopping trip at the mall.  I also intend to travel with this when we go on vacation this summer.  I think it will be good to have at airport.  My son is big for his age (3 and a half), so I was happy to find something that can be used up to 50lbs.  So far this has met the needs that I had when looking for a small stroller."
81,"Munchkin The Cupsicle 8 Oz Insulated My First Straw Cup, Colors May Vary My daughter is 16 months old.My wife tried all possible ways(bought so many sippy cup) to make her drink through cup but didn\'t work after doing lot of research she ordered this Munchkin Straw Cup and it worked !!!!!!!! My daughter started drinking, the very first moment it arrived.Highly recommend for all parents."
82,BOB Infant Car Seat Adapter for Chicco Single Strollers Highly recommended. Cheaper on amazon than anywhere else. Very easy to install and easy to temporarily remove if necessary. Good quality. Feels safe for my newborn\'s chicco keyfit 30.
83,Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey Picked one up yesterday and our one month old has been happy and content all day! First time we put him to bed without crying. Definitely a gift for every new parent.
84,"Kids II Baby Einstein Discover and Play Piano Not only did one key not work, but my granddaughter seems borde with it.  thought she would love it after reading reviews."
85,Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes Excellent entertainment for a child.  It was priced just right and the item is very sturdy.  Highly recommend this purchase.
86,"NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor I wanted a baby monitor that would allow my to hang laundry on the line or take a shower without bringing the baby with me.  This does that.  I love that it\'s not constantly giving static thanks to the voice activation feature, and while I occasionally get an out-of-range beep, it\'s only very occasionally (usually when I\'m moving).  I\'ve had no problem getting a signal anywhere in my 1600 sqft house or 1000 sqft yard.  Also, the battery on this thing seems to last forever.  I have not charged it since receiving it two weeks ago."
87,"Full Coverage all-in-one Hands-Free Pumping Bra &amp; Nursing Tank by Rumina Nursingwear - Black Medium Still on the hunt for the perfect hands free bra/tank. Pretty sure it doesn\'t exist but this comes the closest. When the bottle is getting full , it tends to lose suction and then you have to hold it anyway. The tank is very thick, which is both nice and cumbersome, when wearing under clothes. However, the company is wonderful! Offered me a coupon for ordering again, but I just don\'t need it. I would order true to size, I ordered it too big as well. If anything go smaller."
88,"Ameda Store N Pour Breast Milk Storage Bags with Adapter, 20-Count I love these for my backup supply of milk.  Easy to store if you freeze flat and easy to transport when traveling.  My husband, Mom and Mother-in-law love them when they watch the baby.  I\'m told that you can open and pour while holding the baby.  Too expensive for me to use for normal pumping at work (I use the re-usable bottles for that)."
89,"UPPAbaby G-Lite Stroller, Red Denny Love that there is storage!  And it is so light and easy to fold and stand up.  You can even roll it while it\'s folded!  The shade is extra large so you can avoid too much sun on your LO.  This stroller is also super easy to maneuver.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a simple small stroller.  We have the Britax B-Ready, which is great is large open places.  This stroller is better for smaller places and everyday use."
90,"green sprouts Natural Wood Ring Rattle I thought was going to be a bit bigger, but it is perfect for my 8 month old.  It is light weight and makes a rattle noise.  Doesn\'t seem to dent or chip when bit even though she has 4 teeth."
91,"Infantino Flip Front 2 Back Carrier, Black It is a good product but is not clear how to put the baby when you want to carry him/her in the front or in any other  position.You have to figure out how to do it.  It does have instructions at all.Apart from that the quality is good."
92,"The First Years Compass B540 Booster Seat, Abstract O\'s After reading a review about this car seat I felt this was the best on for my granddaughter. When arrive and install I ask her if she like it and was it confortable, papaw I like it better than the one from walmart.If more companies would build products for children with safety and not the almighty dollar as there motivation.Thank you for a product that well help keep my granddaugher safe. R.L."
93,"Nickelodeon Rocking Sofa, Dora I was trying to decide between the chair and the sofa.  I am glad I got the sofa and for about the same price.  The quality is great! Nicely made. Way better than the cheap foam ones at most retail stores(Which I have).  My daughter loves it. It has the rounded feet that you attach that allows it to rock, at first we used it with out and now we are using it with the rocker feet. The difference is my daughter likes the rocking park but I liked the legs off because she likes to plop in it and it slides around to much and with the legs off it doesn\'t move."
94,"Munchkin Arm &amp; Hammer Disposable Changing Pad - 10 Pack I recently bought these for a vacation where we would be staying in a hotel.  These worked perfect.  We didn\'t have access to a laundry machine, so these were perfect.  They are quite large, so any potential mess will definitly be contained.  I wouldn\'t use these at home daily because it seems wasteful (I use the munchkin changing pad liners at home) but for a vacation these were wonerful!"
95,"Zoli Gummy Sticks Baby Gum Massagers, Green/Orange These sticks are a must have for a teether.  My 3 granddaughters have gotten teething relief, especially when the began teething their molars.  the gag guard gives great peace of mind and they are a must have in my book."
96,"Lambs &amp; Ivy Nap Mat, Pink Monkey My toddler loves her monkey nap mat.  She drags is around with her all day to either lay on or put her dolls to bed in it.  It isn\'t super thick, but I wasn\'t expecting that for this price.  And, she doesn\'t seem to mind the thickness at all.  If she is going to be sleeping on it all night, we fold a thick blanket under it for extra padding, but that is probably not necessary.  I love that the blanket is slightly wider than the mat, so that it fully covers her when she is laying on it.  The mat length is a little short, so I wouldn\'t buy it for any kids over 3 or 4 years old without looking at the measurements first.  (My child is under 2 years old - so it is perfect!)"
97,"Summer Infant Elite DuoMat for Car Seat, Black After doing my research online, I found this to be the best car seat mat for its price and purpose. I love the fact that you can fold the back part for rear-facing carseats so you don\'t have to buy another one for later on. It does have enough cushion to protect your leather seats. I highly recommend this product!"
98,Crocodile Creek Barnyard Placemat This comanies placemats for kiddos are awesome.They are very durrable.My kidds have a couple and they love to sit andpoint things out that they know or to ask questions.
99,"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass Perfect lock.Much better than those door chains, and looks better too.I test it on my garage back door.  I only used one there, and I could not break open the door even if my life depended on it, and I\'m 5\'9&#34; 220 pounds pretty fit.I put 2 on my front door and now have a great piece of mind knowing that probably only a car driving through my front door will break it open.I recommend this lock to all my friends and family.Also looks great with any of the finishes it comes with."
